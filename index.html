          <h2 class="display-4">Definition of NLP</h2>
          <p class="lead text-monospace">Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a sub-field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that is focused on  enabling 
          computers to understand and process human languages, to get computers closer to a human level of understanding language. 
          Artificial Intelligence is changing the way we look at the world surrounded by machine learning. Google, Netflix, data companies, 
          video games and more use AI to comb through large amount of data. NLP draws from many disciplines, including computer science 
          and computational linguistics, in its pursuit to fill the gap 
          between human communication and computer understanding.
          </p>
          <p class="lead text-monospace">NLP is a form of Artificial Intelligence that analyzes the human language. 
          Technologies help machines understand and even communicate with human speech. 
          These underlying tasks are often used in higher-level NLP capabilities, such as:
          </p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Content categorization</strong>. A linguistic-based document summary, including search and indexing, 
              content alerts and duplication detection.
              </li>
              <li><strong>Topic discovery and modeling</strong>. Accurately capture the meaning and themes in text collections, and apply advanced analytics to text, 
              like optimization and forecasting.
              </li>
              <li><strong>Contextual extraction</strong>. Automatically pull structured information from text-based sources.
              </li>
              <li><strong>Sentiment analysis</strong>. Identifying the mood or subjective opinions within large amounts of text, including average sentiment and opinion mining. 
              </li>
              <li><strong>Speech-to-text and text-to-speech conversion</strong>. Transforming voice commands into written text, and vice versa. 
              </li>
              <li><strong>Document summarization</strong>. Automatically generating synopses of large bodies of text.
              </li>
              <li><strong>Machine translation</strong>. Automatic translation of text or speech from one language to another.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              <img src="css/nlp3.png"  style="width: 650px; height: 130px;">
            </p>
          <p class="lead text-monospace">In all these cases, the overarching goal is to take raw language input and use linguistics and algorithms to 
          transform or enrich the text in such a way that it delivers greater value.
          </p>
          <p class="lead text-monospace">NLP depends on the application of the system. Voice-based systems like Alexa or Google Assistant translate your words into text using Hidden Markov Models system (HMM). 
          </p>
            <ul>
              <li>HMM uses math model to determine what you’ve said and translate it into text.
              </li>
              <li> The system breaks word down into parts of speech (through a series of coded grammar 	rules that rely on algorithms).
              </li>
              <li>The ability to categorize what is said in different ways.
              </li>
            </ul>

          <h2 class="display-4">How NLP relates to healthcare</h2>
          <p class="lead text-monospace">Technology and Artificial Intelligence has allowed healthcare to expand and improve how care is given to patients.  Natural Language processing is one of the many newer IT tools that can help simplify the process of care given to patients by 
          their physicians. Currently, NLP uses in healthcare include:</p>
            <ol>
              <li class="display-5">IMPROVING THE PRECISION AND COMPREHENSIVENESS OF THE ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD</li>
                <p class="lead text-monospace">NLP software is able to take spoken or written data and transcribe it for the use of billing, authorizations, clinical decision support and more.    NLP software allows the provider to verbally dictate their notes while it is electronically transcribed quality care with the added bonus of the patient also being involved in the process. This permits the patient to hear what their physician is dictating and they can add to the conversation that is being held about their health.</p>
              <li class="display-5">CLINICAL DECISION SUPPORT</li>
                <p class="lead text-monospace">A major concern in healthcare is preventative care especially for those with severe health complications.  One way to combat this area of concern is to apply NLP algorithms that search for unstructured data. This includes social, behavioral, and other health risk factors all found in a patient’s EHR. An example of this is IBM Watson, a natural language processing machine that was able to identify 8,500 patients at risk of developing heart disease within a year.  Today NLP’s role in risk stratifications is used by clinical research facilities, academia, and government health sectors to name a few.  </p>
              <li class="display-5">IDENTIFYING ERRORS IN THE CARE PATIENTS ARE RECEIVING</li>
                <p class="lead text-monospace">Healthcare providers strive to give efficient care however sometimes mistakes are made.  Fortunately, NLP can measure a physician’s performance of care and any errors that may have occurred in the process can hypothetically be identified.  For example, an algorithm can be designed to distinguish if appropriate meds have been authorized to patients with an illness or disease.  This helps give the patient quality care while also cutting back on unnecessary medical costs. </p>

            <li>&#8658; In 2013, the Department of Veterans Affairs used NLP techniques to review more than 2 billion EHR documents for indications of PTSD, depression, and potential self-harm in veteran patients.  The pilot was 80 percent accurate at identifying the difference between records of screenings for suicide and mentions of actual past suicide attempts.</li>
            <li>&#8658; Researchers at MIT in 2012 were able to attain a 75 percent accuracy rate for deciphering the semantic meaning of specific clinical terms contained in free-text clinical notes, using a statistical probability model to assess surrounding terms and put ambiguous terms into context. </li>
