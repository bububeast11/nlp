          <h2 class="display-4">Definition of NLP</h2>
          <p class="lead text-monospace">Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a sub-field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that is focused on  enabling 
          computers to understand and process human languages, to get computers closer to a human level of understanding language. 
          Artificial Intelligence is changing the way we look at the world surrounded by machine learning. Google, Netflix, data companies, 
          video games and more use AI to comb through large amount of data. NLP draws from many disciplines, including computer science 
          and computational linguistics, in its pursuit to fill the gap 
          between human communication and computer understanding.
          </p>
          <p class="lead text-monospace">NLP is a form of Artificial Intelligence that analyzes the human language. 
          Technologies help machines understand and even communicate with human speech. 
          These underlying tasks are often used in higher-level NLP capabilities, such as:
          </p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Content categorization</strong>. A linguistic-based document summary, including search and indexing, 
              content alerts and duplication detection.
              </li>
              <li><strong>Topic discovery and modeling</strong>. Accurately capture the meaning and themes in text collections, and apply advanced analytics to text, 
              like optimization and forecasting.
              </li>
              <li><strong>Contextual extraction</strong>. Automatically pull structured information from text-based sources.
              </li>
              <li><strong>Sentiment analysis</strong>. Identifying the mood or subjective opinions within large amounts of text, including average sentiment and opinion mining. 
              </li>
              <li><strong>Speech-to-text and text-to-speech conversion</strong>. Transforming voice commands into written text, and vice versa. 
              </li>
              <li><strong>Document summarization</strong>. Automatically generating synopses of large bodies of text.
              </li>
              <li><strong>Machine translation</strong>. Automatic translation of text or speech from one language to another.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              <img src="css/nlp3.png"  style="width: 650px; height: 130px;">
            </p>
          <p class="lead text-monospace">In all these cases, the overarching goal is to take raw language input and use linguistics and algorithms to 
          transform or enrich the text in such a way that it delivers greater value.
          </p>
          <p class="lead text-monospace">NLP depends on the application of the system. Voice-based systems like Alexa or Google Assistant translate your words into text using Hidden Markov Models system (HMM). 
          </p>
            <ul>
              <li>HMM uses math model to determine what you’ve said and translate it into text.
              </li>
              <li> The system breaks word down into parts of speech (through a series of coded grammar 	rules that rely on algorithms).
              </li>
              <li>The ability to categorize what is said in different ways.
              </li>
            </ul>

              <li>&#8658; Many natural language processing systems has the ability to “learn” over time, reabsorbing previous interactions with other patients where results were accurate 
              but did not meet expectations.</li>
              <li>&#8658; These machines operate based on statistical probabilities.</li>

            <p class="lead text-monospace1">&#8658; Reduces EHR frustration regarding documentation and to provide a stronger patient-doctor interaction.</p>
            <p class="lead text-monospace1">&#8658; It follows a more cooperative approach where the physician can dictate out loud as it is being recorded into the patients 
          EHR as the patient can confirm if the information is being correctly documented.</p>
            <p class="lead text-monospace1">&#8658; Applying NLP to EHR data will help integrate results into the patient portal that will help them understand their health information better.</p>
              <ul>
               <li>Having the ability to translate free text to standardized data</li>
               <li>Able to link medical terms to simple definitions to improve patient EHR understanding and patient portal experience.</li>
               <li>NLP essentially will work as a virtual assistant to aid with administration duties as well as customer service and help desk tasks. </li>
              </ul>
            <p class="lead text-monospace1">&#8658; NLP algorithms are developed to help extract relevant EHR data that can help identify potential errors in care 
          delivery or in helping detect complex patients who may benefit from enhanced care coordination.</p>
              <ul>
                <li>One research team applied an NLP tool to unstructured data to identify adverse drug events in media literature and social media postings.</li>
                <li>Achieved 92.7% accuracy & 93.6% precision</li>
                <li>NLP algorithms can also offer a solution that can identify key terms associated with the social determinants of health.</li>
                <li>2018 algorithm used to help providers measure the quality of inpatient care and monitor adherence to clinical guidelines.</li>
              </ul>
          <h2 class="display-4">Cons:</h2>  
            <p class="lead text-monospace1">&#8658; Speech recognition software prone to leaving errors in EHR that can put patients at significant risk of harm.</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Largest portion of errors were related to medications while surgical notes had the fewest.</li>
              </ul>
            <p class="lead text-monospace1">&#8658; Solutions to speech recognition/natural language processing errors:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Human transcriptionist to review information.</li>
                <li>Users may need coaching on how to best phrase key elements of the clinical notes and which types of sounds or words are most likely to be mistranslated 
                and how to adequately train NLP software to recognize a unique accent or speech pattern.</li>
                <li>Clinical assurance and auditing programs and awareness of these errors to come up with strategies to reduce them.</li>
              </ul>
            <p class="lead text-monospace1">&#8658; Narrative Text and “doctor speak” – word disambiguation or fragmented words makes up at least a third of clinical errors due to certain abbreviations having multiple meanings.</p> 
              <ul>
                <li>ex) discharge – bodily secretion or being released from hospital, MD – doctor of medicine or mental disorder.</li>
              </ul>
            <p class="lead text-monospace1">&#8658; Humans can usually decipher abbreviations and such due to context and other surrounding information, 
            NLP technology still has a way to go before it can have that level of reliability.</p>
            <p class="lead text-monospace1">&#8658; Eventually NLP tools will be able to bridge that gap between the amount of data being generated on a daily 
            basis to piece certain words to context.</p>
